PTL: PHP Template Loader
------------------------

The PTL is designed to be a quickly-deployable template loader for basic static
websites. The .htaccess file provides some simple rewriting/piping to allow
easy access to content files.

Eg. a user visits [your-website.com/about], the PTL then checks to see if a
content page exists for about, and either displays it within a given template,
or displays the default content page.


How to use
----------

1. Extract all files and upload to an accessible folder on your webserver.
   The 'templates' folder contains an example template and content files.
2. Edit config.php and change any variables.
3. Create a new template file in the templates folder (default is 'templates'
   in the base path). Use %CONTENT% in place of where you would find content 
   within your design. See the example template 'tpl_default.html' for 
   guidance.
4. Create content files with the prefix 'cnt_' and the suffix '.html'. For 
   example, 'cnt_home.html' is loaded when you visit [your-website.com/home].
    
   Use %IMGDIR% in place of your image directory, local to the template folder.
   Use %CSSDIR% in place of your CSS directory, local to the template folder.
   Use %JSDIR% in place of your JavaScript directory, local to the template folder.

   See the example files provided for guidance.
