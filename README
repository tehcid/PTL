PTL: PHP Template Loader
------------------------

The PTL is designed to be a quickly-deployable template loader for basic static
websites. The .htaccess file provides some simple rewriting/piping to allow
easy access to content files.

Eg. a user visits [your-website.com/about], the PTL then checks to see if a
content page exists for about, and either displays it within a given template,
or displays the default content page.


How to use
----------

1. Extract all files and upload to an accessible folder on your webserver.
2. Edit config.php and change any variables.
3. Create a new template file in the templates folder (default is 'templates'
   in the base path). Use %CONTENT% in place of where you would find content 
   within your design. See the example template 'tpl_default.html' for 
   guidance.
4. Create content files with the prefix 'cnt_' and the suffix '.html'. For 
   example, 'cnt_home.html' is loaded when you visit [your-website.com/home].
    
   Use %IMGDIR% in place of your image directory.
   Use %CSSDIR% in place of your CSS directory.

   See the example files provided for guidance.
